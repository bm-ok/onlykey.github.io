## Planned Future Features

- User selectable challenge code enabling and adjustable length. Disabling challenge code would be desired for chat and a longer challenge code may be desired for increased security.

- App should know when incorrect challenge code is entered so user doesn't have to wait for timeout. OnlyKey sends return key after successful PIN, maybe press return twice to indicate failed PIN.

- Instead of key slots allow use of a certain key by keyID or label
